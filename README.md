# Modelling-and-Simulation

Here are assorted modelling and simulation projects I've done in MATLAB. The models themselves are derived from first principles under simplifying assumptions, after which genetic strings were used to find optimal parameters in accordance with the context-specific cost function. 

A brief description of each project is as follows:
In the UAV project, we model a swarm of UAV drones, tasked with mapping arbitrary targets while avoiding interspersed obstacles. 
In the printer project, we're simulate the operation of a free-form robotic 3D printer. 
In the food project, we model the extrusion of a two-phase food slurry. 
In the heat project, we model the one dimensional heat equation using the finite difference method.
In the fireworks project, we simulate the behavior of a two-stage firework comprising a propulsive and explosive charge.
